## Tim Hyson
##### contact:  tjhyson@gmail.com  
A junior developer who's embarking on a new career after 12 successful years in the film industry.  I studied code at Makers Academy and fell in love with software design and development.  I embrace test-driven development and pair programming as ways to uncover simple solutions to complex problems.   

I am now looking to continue developing alongside like-minded individuals, in an environment that encourages continuous learning and innovation.

### Core Competencies

#### Software Development
My love of coding began with self-directed online tutorials, but I wanted to accelerate my learning, and Makers Academy offered me that opportunity by distilling key principles and industry best practices into an intensive bootcamp.  *Follow links below to my github repositories.*

- Ruby and JavaScript have given me an introduction to reasoning like a programmer
- [Rails] (https://github.com/timhyson/timstagram) and [Angular] (https://github.com/timhyson/ReadingList) have opened my eyes to the potential for scaffolding apps using frameworks
- RSpec and Jasmine have given me direction and confidence in the accuracy of my code

#### Communicating with clarity
After graduation, I was selected by Makers Academy to provide a first point of contact for students encountering technical problems.  This involves explaining complex ideas in simple terms, reinforcing my understanding in the process.

#### Problem solving
At what point does attention to detail become OCD?!  I have a logical and creative mindset, and helping others who are blocked has given me experience of reading and understanding someone else's code; an essential skill for bug hunting.

#### Teamwork and collaboration
Combining the self-motivation and self-discipline of a seasoned freelancer with the communication and easy compromise of a committed team worker.

#### Responsive learning
I'm quick to adapt to different approaches.  And learning to feel comfortable with the unknown.

## Work
**Freelance camera technician** (2003 - 2015)  [(list of credits on IMDB.com)](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2575314/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)  
Television dramas and feature films, from BBC and ITV to MGM and Universal.  Though seemingly unrelated, many commonalities exist - a team of individuals with a variety of specialisms collaborating on a project, adapting to change, troubleshooting issues before they arise and resolving them if they do.

**Makers Academy** (Oct 2015 - present)

Support students encountering blockers.  I don't necessarily have the answer but I'm becoming proficient with google and Stack Overflow!
